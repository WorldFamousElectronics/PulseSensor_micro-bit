# PulseSensor_micro-bit

This repository holds the work that we are doing to integrate the Pulse Sensor into the BBC micro:bit ecosystem. For now, we have a couple of short and sweet examples for the micro:bit. Soon, we will have more comprehensive advanced code blocks and libraries to connect your micro:bit to the Pulse Sensor.
